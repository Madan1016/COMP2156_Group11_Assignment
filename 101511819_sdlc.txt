DevOps plays a crucial role in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) by improving collaboration, automation, and efficiency. 
It bridges the gap between development and operations teams, ensuring faster delivery of high-quality software. 
Key benefits include:
- Continuous Integration (CI) ensures code is tested frequently.
- Continuous Deployment (CD) allows rapid and reliable releases.
- Automation reduces errors and speeds up workflows.
- Monitoring and feedback loops improve software performance and security.
By integrating DevOps in SDLC, organizations can innovate faster and maintain reliable software systems.
