DevOps plays a crucial role in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) by integrating 
development and operations teams for faster and more reliable software delivery. 

Key benefits of DevOps in SDLC:
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Frequent code integration reduces errors.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Faster release cycles with minimal downtime.
- **Automation**: Repetitive tasks like testing and deployment are automated.
- **Collaboration**: Improved communication between developers and IT teams.
- **Scalability**: Cloud-based DevOps solutions allow for efficient resource management.

By adopting DevOps, companies can achieve higher efficiency, faster releases, 
and improved software quality, making it a critical practice in modern software engineering.
CI/CD ensures fast and reliable software deployment in SDLC.
Automation in SDLC reduces human errors and increases efficiency.
DevOps ensures better security through automated compliance checks.
